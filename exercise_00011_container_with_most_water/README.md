# Container With Most Water

You are given an integer array `height` of length `n`. There are `n` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the `i^th` line are `(i, 0)` and `(i, height[i])`.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.

## Example 1:

```
Input: height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]
Output: 49
```

## Example 2:

```
Input: height = [1, 1]
Output: 1
```

## Example 3:

```
Input: height = [3, 9, 3, 4, 7, 2, 12, 6]
Output: 45
```
